## Case Study

Today we are going to use all the skills we have learnt in the
past 2 weeks to tackle a real problem in the industry. The problem
is churn prediction with a ride-sharing company in San Francisco.
Since the data is sourced from a real company, we ask you not to share
the dataset. See more about the problem in [group.md](group.md). You can choose
to work individually or in groups of 4 or fewer.
